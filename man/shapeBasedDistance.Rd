\usage{
shapeBasedDistance(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{1st numeric vector/time series.}

\item{y}{2nd numeric vector/time series.}
}
\value{
The dissimilarity as numeric from the range [0,2].
}
\description{
Computes the dissimilarity as \emph{1 - maximum normalized cross-correlation
coefficient} as described by Paparrizos and Gravano (2015). Multi-variate
time series are handled by calculating the cross-correlation between corresponding
attributes in \code{x} and \code{y}, averaging over attributes and then taking
the average cross-correlation at the lag which maximizes it.
