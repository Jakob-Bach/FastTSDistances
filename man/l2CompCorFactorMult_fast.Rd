\title{Multi-variate L2 Complexity Correction Factor}
\usage{
l2CompCorFactorMult_fast(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{1st numeric matrix/multi-variate time series.}

\item{y}{2nd numeric vector/multi-variate time series.}
}
\value{
The complexity correction factor as double. Is infinity if one series
is constant in all attributes and the other one not.
}
\description{
Calculates the complexity correction factor for the distance between two
multi-variate time series, using the L2 norm of each time series' attributes'
diff vectors as complexity estimate. Can be combined with any distance as a
scaling factor (distances between vectors of different complexity become more
prominent). Does not obey the triangular equality if its combined with the
Euclidean distance, but a relaxed version (see reference).
}
\details{
This factor is currently integrated as a parameter into the L2 distance and
dynamic time warping distance of this package.
