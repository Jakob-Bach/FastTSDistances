\title{Normalized Cross-Correlation Function}
\usage{
crossCorNormalized(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{1st numeric vector/time series.}

\item{y}{2nd numeric vector/time series.}
}
\value{
The normalized cross-correlation as vector (length equals
\emph{|x| + |y| - 1}.
}
\description{
Computes the cross-correlation function between two vectors and normalizes
it with the l2 norms of the vectors (so values are between -1 and 1). Internally,
convolution and FFT are used as described by Paparrizos and Gravano (2015).
