\title{Variation of Information and Normalized Mutual Information}
\usage{
VI_fast(assignments1, assignments2, normalizeAndInvert = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{assignments1}{Integer vector of cluster assignments containing only values
from 1 to k with k = number of clusters (code depends on this!).}

\item{assignments2}{Integer vector of cluster assignments containing only values
from 1 to k with k = number of clusters.}

\item{normalizeAndInvert}{Should the Variation of Information be normalized
to [0,1] and inverted such that high values indicate similar clusterings?}
}
\value{
The Variation of Information as double (in [0, entropy1+entropy2] without
normalization and [0,1] else).
}
\description{
Calculates the Variation of Information index introduced by of Meila (2003) to
compare two cluster assignment vectors (external cluster validation). It is a
value greater or equal 0, lower values indicating more similarity (it is based
on the entropy of the single assignments and the mutual information of the joint
distribution). Optionally, the index can be normalized to [0,1] as proposed by
Wu, Xiong and Chen (2009). After normalization, we take 1 - normalizedValue so
that higher values indicate better clustering quality (as it is for indices
like Rand, Fowlkes-Mallows); the result equals the Normalized Mutual Information
of Fred and Jain (2002).
}
\details{
We use the base 2 logarithm for calculating entropy and mutual information.
