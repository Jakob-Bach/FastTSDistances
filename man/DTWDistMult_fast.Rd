\title{(Fast) Multi-variate Dynamic Time Warping Dissimilarity}
\usage{
DTWDistMult_fast(x, y, cid = FALSE, cortK = -1, normalize = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{1st numeric matrix/multi-variate time series.}

\item{y}{2nd numeric matrix/multi-variate time series.}

\item{cid}{Should the distance be made "complexity-invariant"
(\code{\link{l2CompCorFactorMult_fast}})?}

\item{cortK}{Should the temporal behavior (correlation) of the time series'
diff vectors be considered (\code{\link{cortFactorMult_fast}})? A factor
smaller than 0 means no, higher factors will be used as parameter \code{k}
in the temporal correlation scaling function.}

\item{normalize}{Divide by the length of the longer time series (= minimum
amount of assignment steps) to account for series of different lengths in
your dataset.}
}
\value{
The distance as double.
}
\description{
Fast version of multi-variate dynamic time warping (unconstrained, symmetric1
step pattern, L2 distance for point-to-point comparisons) which uses a cyclic
access strategy with a smaller cost matrix; inspired by the C implementation of
dynamic time warping in \code{dtwclust::dtw_basic()}, but cuts even more overhead.
}
\details{
Be aware that it is not really a distance in the strict sense, as DTW
violates the triangle inequality.
