This R package contains fast (mostly C++) implementations of time series dissimilarities, simple aggregation functions for time series and cluster validity indices.
The package is not on `CRAN`, but can be installed manually.
Assuming you have installed the package `devtools`, you can simply run `devtools::install_github("Jakob-Bach/FastTSDistances")` to install `FastTSDistances` into your local R package repository.
After installation, you can call `help(package = "FastTSDistances")` to get an overview of the package's functions.

## Aggregation Functions

All aggregation functions aggregate intervals of a fixed length from univariate time series (=vectors).

- piecewise kurtosis
- piecewise maximum
- piecewise mean [1, 2]
- piecewise median
- piecewise minimum
- piecewise skewness
- piecewise standard deviation
- Symbolic Aggregate Approximation [3] (SAX)

## Cluster Validity Indices

We provide internal as well as external cluster validity indices.

- (external) Conditional entropy (e.g. in [1])
- Entropy of an integer vector containing values from 1 to k (like cluster assignments)
- (external) Fowlkes-Mallows Index [2] (optional: normalization [1])
- (internal) Generalized Davies-Bouldin Index [3] based on intra- and inter-cluster dissimilarities; also inverted version which is higher for better validity
- (internal) Generalized Dunn Index [4, 5] based on intra- and inter-cluster dissimilarities
- (external) Phi Coefficient [6]
- (external) Purity (e.g. in [1])
- (external) Rand Index [7, 8] (optional: normalization[1])
- (external) van Dongen measure [9] (optional: normalization [1])
- (external) Variation of Information [10] (optional: normalization [1] and inversion to Normalized Mutual Information [11])

## Dissimilarity Functions

All dissimilarities support univariate time series (=vectors) as well as multivariate time series (matrices with the columns representing different attributes).

- Complexity-Invariant Distance (CID) [1] for L2 metric and DTW
- Compression-/complexity-based dissimilarity [2, 3] (variant of CDM, using SAX representation and zip compression)
- Correlaion-based distance [4]
- Temporal correlation correction factor (CORT) [5] for L2 metric and DTW
- Edit Distance on Real Sequences (EDR) [6] (optional: Sakoe-Chiba window [7])
- Edit Distance with Real Penalty (ERP) [8] (optional: Sakoe-Chiba window [7])
- Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) [9] (optional: Sakoe-Chiba window [7])
- L1, L2, Lmax metric
- Permutation distribution dissimilarity [10]
- Shaped-Based Distance (SBD) [11]
